This readme file needs to be updated. I am leaving this text here as a
placeholder instead of the previous out-of-date text.

== To-do list

* Think about safety and robustness in terms of power outages
* Make sure the repository comes with empty folders `data/shortly`,
  `data/daily`, and `logs/daily` when cloning.
* Check that TOML output is usable
