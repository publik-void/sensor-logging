= Sensor Logging
Lasse Schlör

This is a readme file which mostly contains my notes for possible future
improvements. I think the rest of this repository does not need major
documentation, since there already is a bit of documentation in the code and
I'll probably keep the rest in my mind, roughly, at least. At the moment, the
main part of this repository are the two scripts `minly.py` and `daily.py` that
are run each minute and each day, respectively, by cron.

== What I could improve

* Safety regarding system poweroffs
** Maybe I should look for a way to block a poweroff while a script is running,
  such that I can prevent potential data loss should I ever poweroff the Pi at 4
  in the morning.
** Of course, a power outage would be another kind of problem that may be of
  concern. Decreasing the compression time and/or adding in a guard for already
  existing archives may be a way to go here…
